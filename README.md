# Raspberry-HighPrecision-AD-DA-Board-DAC-Test
I couldn't find at anywhere a .c file for wiringPi to give me analog output at desired value in Waveshare High Precision AD-DA Board's DAC outputs. After editing the DA examples I managed to create a code myself, I hope that will being handiful.

The most of the coding is not by me, I just edited the codes in the example code in the waveshare website: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/High-Precision_AD/DA_Board#Datasheets , and altered the demo codes and put the .h files in to the according library.
